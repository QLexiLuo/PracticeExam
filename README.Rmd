## Midterm.
  
#### 1.  Map the delay by destination.
  
  Compute the average delay by destination, then join on the airports data frame so you can show the spatial distribution of delays. Hereâ€™s an easy way to draw a map of the United States.  You are welcome to use this code or some other code. 

```{r} 
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)

airports %>%
  semi_join(flights, c("faa" = "dest")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(lon, lat)) +
  borders("state") +
  geom_point() +
  coord_quickmap()
```

You might want to use the size or colour of the points to display the average delay for each airport.

```{r}
flights
planes
airlines
airports
weather

# put your answer here.
flights2 = flights %>%
  group_by(dest)%>%
  summarize(mean_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = T))
airports %>%
  left_join(flights2, c("faa" = "dest")) %>%
  filter(complete.cases(mean_delay))%>%
  ggplot(aes(lon, lat)) +
  borders("state") +
  geom_point(aes(col = mean_delay)) +
  coord_quickmap()
```


#### 2.   Do planes trade ownership?

You might expect that there's an implicit relationship between plane and airline, because each plane is flown by a single airline. Explore this conjecture using data. (Let's assume that the tail number of a plane does not change.)

```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(tailnum,carrier) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  group_by(tailnum)%>%
  summarise(n = n())
```

# Find the tail num in flights that don't appear in planes


#### 3a.  Plane's average speed.

Notice that ```flights$air_time``` is in minutes.  Make a new column that is the air time in hours. 

```{r}
flights %>% mutate(time_hours = air_time/60)
```


#### 4b. Average speed

For each flight, compute the average speed of that flight (in miles per hour).  Then, for each plane, compute the average of those average speeds. Display it in a histogram. You can use a base R histogram ```hist``` or ggplot's ```geom_histogram```. 

```{r}
flights %>% mutate(time_hours = air_time/60,
                   avg_speed = distance/time_hours) %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  summarize(mean_speed = mean(avg_speed)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mean_speed)) + geom_histogram()
```




#### 5. Bonus

Make a table where each row is a destination, each column is a carrier, and each element is the number of times that the carrier has flown to that destination.  Ensure that you only count flights that arrived at the destination. 

```{r}
flights %>% 
  filter(complete.cases(arr_time)) %>%
  group_by(carrier,dest) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = dest, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) %>%
  view()
  
flights %>% 
  drop_na(arr_time) %>%
  group_by(carrier,dest) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = dest, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) %>%
  view()
```
